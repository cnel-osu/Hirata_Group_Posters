# Description of the Observation Cosmic Ray Random Walk Plot:
Pictured here is a simulated trajectory for a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) impacting a thin semiconductor material 
and the random walk behavior characteristic of a delta rays, which are electrons knocked off by the incoming particle.
The Image Combination (IMCOM) software developed to generate images from infrared (IR) data for the upcoming Nancy Roman 
Space Telescope takes in simulated masks of GCRs impacting the satelliteâ€™s HgCdTe sensors during operation on-orbit 
at the Earth-Sun L2 point and uses these masks to remove noise and artifacts caused by the GCRs and any secondary particles 
created during its journey through the sensor.
